									<h2>WordBlower</h2>
									<p>WordBlower is a puzzle game for mobile platfroms. Goal is clearing each level by finding meaningfull words.<br/>
										Words created randomly to allowing playing same level more than one. I improved my combinatorics knowledge and experience,<br/>
										along with UI implementation for mobile games, designing for target users and expectations of different age groups.<br/>
										<b>codes of the project can be shared upon request.</b>

									<h2>Nothing Found a Ludum Dare 45 Game</h2>
									<p>
										This is my entry project to Ludum Date 45 event under theme of start with nothing. Ludum Dare is a game jam which limits people to create a game with given theme in 72 hours.<br/>
										I made my game in little less than 48 hour period and this is my first 3D game project with Unity. I managed to create a good dialog and subtitle system and learned some basic 3D FPS game elements.<br/>
										Developing a game in such a limited time improved me in crises management and agile project management. I also learned HTML5 and WebGL building in Unity and what I need to take care for these platform builds.

									<h2>Snake Game</h2>
									<p>This is a classic snake implementation made for iphones. I made this project in a short 2 week period of using macbook.<br/>
									Upon getting macbook I started to work on this game and I used swift with spritekit. I improved classic snake implementation by adding different snakes.<br/>
									This project let me experience ios app development and swift language.</p>

									<h2>2D Game Engine with OpenGL</h2>
									<p>After Using libGDX I wanted to code a basic implementation of a game engine which satisfies general needs of me.<br/>
									I headed of and started to learn OpenGL by following some tutorials by some coders who works for some well known game companies.<br/>
									Learning backbone of game engines and how compiter talks/manages gpu have been valuable lesson for me to write better code.<br/>
									I am improving it in my spare times and I started a 3D version of it for my University course.</p>

									<h2>Sliding Vapour</h2>
									<p>My Unity 3D game project. This is infinite runner type game. Player tries to escape obstacles while collecting maximum points.<br/>
									Obstacles created randomly for every game so I learned basics of combinatorics in this project and adding some power ups made use of combinatorics more important.<br/>
									I learned some UI design and what to not do. For mobile versions, I implemented touch controls and tilt controls as two different control scheme. These was first experience with both touch and tilt sensor.</p>

									<p>My libGDX project for mobile phones. This was my first experience with libGDX library and java development.<br/>

									I can write efficient codes in other game engines keeping processes of libGDX in my mind.</p>

									<h2>Vision Based Navigation Robot</h2>
									<p>Me and my colleague made a Vision Based Navigation Robot for a University Project with supervision of computer vision professor.
									I worked as programmer and my colleague handled electronics part. I worked on RaspberryPi version 2 with OpenCV and Python languages.
									I learned about OpenCV, computer vision algorithms and Python language. Since RaspberryPi version 2 does not offer so much workspace for OpenCV,
									I had to write codes as efficient as I can. I made some basic shape and color detection systems and motor controllers while getting enough framerate to implement Time To Collusion with mono camera setup.</p>
